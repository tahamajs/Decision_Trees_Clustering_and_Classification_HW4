## **Overview**

This assignment focuses on  **decision tree classifiers, clustering methods, and spam classification** . You will:

* Implement a **Decision Tree classifier** for spam email classification.
* Explore the **Bias-Variance tradeoff** in tree-based models.
* Analyze  **clustering techniques** , including  **DBSCAN and OPTICS** .
* Implement **K-Means clustering** for customer segmentation.

---

## **Assignment Structure**

The homework consists of  **five main questions** , covering both theoretical and practical aspects.

### **ðŸ“Œ Question 1: Decision Tree for Spam Classification (20 points)**

* Implement a **Decision Tree classifier** using  **Information Gain** .
* Train the model on **email data** to classify emails as  **spam or ham** .
* Use **3-level depth pruning** to improve generalization.
* Apply the trained model on a **test dataset** and predict email categories.

### **ðŸ“Œ Question 2: Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Decision Trees (20 points)**

* Compare  **Decision Trees and Bagging Methods** .
* Discuss **bias and variance tradeoffs** in different learning algorithms.
* Analyze how **model complexity** affects  **overfitting and underfitting** .

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Question 3: Clustering Methods â€“ Density-Based Models (20 points)**

* Understand the role of **clustering** in unsupervised learning.
* Investigate **density-based clustering** using  **DBSCAN** .
* Compare **DBSCAN vs. OPTICS** for identifying non-linearly separable clusters.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Question 4: Decision Tree for Restaurant Wait Time Prediction (25 points)**

* Train a **decision tree model** to predict if a customer will wait at a restaurant.
* Use **entropy and Gini impurity** for splitting.
* Implement the tree  **with and without pre-built libraries** .
* Compare results using different **feature selection** techniques.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Question 5: K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation (25 points)**

* Perform **K-Means clustering** on customer transaction data.
* Analyze clusters based on:
  * **Annual income**
  * **Spending score**
  * **Gender & age distribution**
* Determine the **optimal number of clusters** using  **elbow method** .
* Visualize clusters in  **2D and 3D plots** .
